# Spriha Tucker

Welcome to my (very bare bones) website. I am a Product Manager building data solutions for AI-enabled products at Google. My past experience as a PM includes helping build Android's Internet of Things platform, launching new advertising products for Ads on Google Search (while I was on the Google APM program) and building out A/B testing and experiment infrastructure at Microsoft. Prior to becoming a PM, I spent some time as a Quant Trader developing quantitative-trading models and electronic trade-execution algorithms at Morgan Stanley.

I attended the University of Pennsylvania, where I studied Econometrics for my Bachelors degree, Computer Science for my Masters degree and obtained a language certificate in Mandarin Chinese.

I enjoy playing the piano, exploring engineering and business problems and tinkering with electronics.
