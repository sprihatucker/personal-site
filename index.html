<h1>Spriha Tucker</h1>
<p> Welcome to my crappy website. Glad to have you here for the next few seconds, or, if I'm lucky, minutes :)</p>
	
<p> I am currently an entrepreneur + software engineer. I went through Y-Combinator's most recent batch (YC W20), with my first company: Frequestish. We built software + financial products for brick-&-mortar SMBs to help them compete with the likes of Starbucks and help increase foot traffic to their stores. We had started it before Covid-19 was even a word, and were making exciting progress when unfortunately, it did become a word (and a very feared one). In the Covid-19 world, the very premise of our business was invalidated. So we shut it down. </p>
	
<p> Before the whole Frequentish adventure, I was a Product Manager building data solutions for AI-enabled products at Google. My past experience as a PM includes helping build Android's Internet of Things platform, launching new advertising products for Ads on Google Search (while I was on Google's APM program) and building out A/B testing and experiment infrastructure at Microsoft. Prior to becoming a PM, I spent some time as a Quant Trader at Morgan Stanley developing quantitative-trading models and electronic trade-execution algorithms for equities.
</p>

<p>I attended the University of Pennsylvania, where I studied Econometrics for my Bachelors degree, Computer Science for my Masters degree and obtained a language certificate in Mandarin Chinese.</p>

<p>I enjoy playing the piano, exploring engineering and business problems and tinkering with electronics. Do reach out to me if you'd like to discuss any of those things!
</p>

<p>I can be reached at spriha.tucker(at)gmail.com, or via the usual social media channels (I believe I'm the only one (so far) with the name "Spriha Tucker").
</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting my site! I'll leave you with a recording of song I enjoyed playing on the piano. The ending was a challenge to get right, but I think the way it sounds makes it worth it!</p>
