<h1>Spriha Tucker</h1>
<p>
	Welcome to my (very bare bones) website. I am a Product Manager building data solutions for AI-enabled products at Google. My past experience as a PM includes helping build Android's Internet of Things platform, launching new advertising products for Ads on Google Search (while I was on Google's APM program) and building out A/B testing and experiment infrastructure at Microsoft. Prior to becoming a PM, I spent some time as a Quant Trader at Morgan Stanley developing quantitative-trading models and electronic trade-execution algorithms for equities.
</p>

<p>I attended the University of Pennsylvania, where I studied Econometrics for my Bachelors degree, Computer Science for my Masters degree and obtained a language certificate in Mandarin Chinese.</p>

<p>I enjoy playing the piano, exploring engineering and business problems and tinkering with electronics. Do reach out to me if you'd like to discuss any of those things!
</p>

<p>I can be reached at spriha.tucker(at)gmail.com, or via the usual social media channels (I believe I'm the only one (so far) with the name "Spriha Tucker").
</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting my site! I'll leave you with a recording of song I enjoyed playing on the piano. The ending was a challenge to get right, but I think the way it sounds makes it worth it!</p>
